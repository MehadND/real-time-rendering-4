  #### Goal
  1. The goal of this part of the project was to refactor the code in such ways so that we can encapsuulate the data and its functionality, i.e. Separate/break-down the functionality of a GameObject and a Shader (ShaderTechnique) into different classes.
  2. Show the relationship between a [GameObject](https://github.com/MehadND/real-time-rendering-4/blob/0cfb8ef77be6ad0702a423c0a3d99f58f9a4429c/gt41samples%20(1)/gt41samples/renderingproject/GameObject.h) & a [Shader](https://github.com/MehadND/real-time-rendering-4/blob/0cfb8ef77be6ad0702a423c0a3d99f58f9a4429c/gt41samples%20(1)/gt41samples/renderingproject/ShaderTechnique.h)

  #### UML Diagram: Showing Relationship between GameObject class & ShaderTechnique class
  ![UML Diagram: Showing Relationship between GameObject class & ShaderTechnique class](https://github.com/MehadND/real-time-rendering-4/blob/0cfb8ef77be6ad0702a423c0a3d99f58f9a4429c/gt41samples%20(1)/gt41samples/renderingproject/part1%20UML%20diagram.png)
  > As we can see in the UML diagram above, there is a relationship that exists between a GameObject and a ShaderTechnique. This relationship can be described as <i>has-a</i>. This basically means that a GameObject (instance) has-a ShaderTechnique or in other words an object has-a shader. 
  
  #### Code Implementation
  ```cpp
  // This class inherits members and functions of ShaderTechnique class as private members and functions
  class GameObject : private ShaderTechnique
  ```
